===================

A RubyMotion kettlebell snatch cadence timer for the CMVO2 Test protocol from Kenneth Jay's [Viking Warrior Conditioning](http://www.amazon.com/Viking-Warrior-Conditioning-Kenneth-Jay/dp/0938045040).

It'll chime once on the minute when you need to switch hands and sound a different chime each time you should do a snatch. After 240 seconds (the fourth hand-switch chime), go all out and count your snatches until the timer hits 300. Boom.
